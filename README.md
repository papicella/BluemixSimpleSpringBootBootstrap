This demo is using the IBM DevOps service linked to this GitHub repo so as changes are committed it
starts a pipeline to build the code and re-push the application to the US Dallas PUBLIC Bluemix region
in the org "pasapi@au1.ibm.com" using the space "dev".

The application is called "BluemixSimpleSpringBootBootstrap"
